# California COVID19 Data
We are re-organizing the COVID19 reports from the CA State Dept. of Health and from the Open COVID-19 Data Working Group. You can find additional information on the Open COVID-19 Data Working Group [here](https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019) and on the CA State Dept. of Health [here](https://data.ca.gov/organization/california-department-of-public-health). It's really critical to point out that we haven't yet performed proper validation on the CA state data and would very much welcome contributors who are either interested in suggesting code changes, validating data, and/or contributing new data sets. In addition, please see the specific license, warranty, and copyright information for our code and each individual data set.
